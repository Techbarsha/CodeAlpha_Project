# CodeAlpha_cybersecurity_task👩‍💻
I presented here a summary of the tasks I did during my Cybersecurity Internship at Code Alpha.

## Task1
I was given to build a network sniffer in Python that captures and analyses netrwork traffic. This essentially help me to understand how data flows on a network and how network packets are structured. By the way, I improve my Python knowledge, so nice !!!

## Task2
Here, it was about to educate people on phishing attacks, to help them recognizing and avoiding phishing emails, websites and social engineering tactics. I think it will be so useful.

## Task3
I was assigned to review the code of an application for security vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for secure coding practices.


Thanks,Happy coding🗿
